# Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
Loan Prediction using machine learning

# Objective
In this project, we aim to train a model that can predict loan approval for individuals of different backgrounds based on its key features, including the person’s income, home ownership kind , loan amount, e.t.c… By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can uncover insights and patterns in the data to build an accurate predictive model.

# Data Source
Kaggle datasets
This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data.
